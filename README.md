# Pixel-Native Geo-Estimation Engine  
**Advanced Geospatial Inference from Low-Context Visual Inputs**

a pixel-native **geolocation inference framework** engineered to extract actionable geospatial intelligence from **low-context, metadata-depleted imagery**.  
The system performs multi-layer spatial reasoning via a hybrid pipeline combining **computer vision**, **geospatial feature extraction**, and **probabilistic region-ranking models**.

## Core Capabilities

- **Biome & Ecoregion Classification**  
  High-resolution modeling of vegetation biomes, climate zones, soil chromatics, and spectral gradients.

- **Built-Environment Fingerprinting**  
  Detection of architectural phenotypes, roofing topology, infrastructure typologies, and regional construction heuristics.

- **Terrain & Physical Geometry Modeling**  
  DEM-like terrain segmentation, curvature estimation, vanishing-point reconstruction, horizon distortion metrics, and solar-azimuth hemispheric inference.

- **Probabilistic Geo-Inference Engine**  
  Multi-stage region scoring with hierarchical clustering, spatial likelihood heatmaps, and texture-driven contextual disambiguation.

- **Pixel-Only Geolocation**  
  No EXIF.  
  No GPS.  
  No auxiliary metadata.  
  **Pure vision-native geospatial reasoning.**

## Technical Architecture

integrates a multi-component analytic stack:

- **Deep spectral-texture encoders** for fine-grained visual signal extraction  
- **Cross-domain feature fusion** spanning environmental, structural, and topographic channels  
- **Spatial likelihood modeling** using probabilistic geospatial inference  
- **Hierarchical reasoning pipelines** mirroring expert GeoInt analyst workflows  

Optimized for **high-noise, low-context imagery**, supporting OSINT investigations, misinformation verification, crisis mapping, and geospatial triage.
